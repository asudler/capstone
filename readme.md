## Project Description
To be written once I have a better understanding of what this project entails...

## Philosophy
One of my goals is to write most of the numerical methods for this project myself rather than to rely heavily on external scientific libraries. The cynical observer may comment that these libraries could likely run my numerics faster than my code. Nevertheless, the point of doing this senior research project is __to learn__---not only about the propagation of light through a quantum-mechanical medium, but also about programming languages and the mathematical theory behind commonly used numerical recipes. By demystifying the blackbox, I hope to better understand the errors I get in my own code as well as those that will appear when I use external libraries and other languages in the future.

By the way, if you see some bad code while browsing this repository, please let me know. It would be great to learn and improve!
